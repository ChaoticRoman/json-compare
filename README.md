# JSON comparator

Simple application to open all JSON files in a folder that allows you 
to see them all or most of them at once and highlight a line in all
documents.

It is aimed at bunch of JSONs that have same fields and structure,
and differs in values only.

App has been made by GPT-4 as an experiment to what it can and can not
do. The chat is [here][1].
